- It looks like the usage counter / warning is displayed only after reaching a certain threshold (e.g., when usage is close to the limit). If this is intentional, please make the rule explicit (e.g., “Shown when usage ≥ X%”) so users don’t feel it’s random.

- Consider showing a stable indicator (even a small “Usage: x/100”) at all times, and only switching to a stronger warning state when the threshold is reached. This would reduce confusion and make the experience more predictable or show it for begining
